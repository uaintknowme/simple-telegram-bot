# Simple Reply Telegram Bot

### I want to create a simple reply Telegram bot just for test GO and [Go Telegram Bot API](https://go-telegram-bot-api.dev/)

<br />

## Why I choose this journey?

Recently I decided to change my career, and this decision needs to learn new skills like the Database and back-end.
I started to learn Go, and I decided to create a simple reply with a telegram bot based on a simple reply condition project to warm up myself and continue my journey and ready for another challenge.

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=[YOUR_TOKEN]
```

- finally `go run main.go`

## Tech Stacks:
